The Soft Drink Market Insight Challenge is a data visualization competition focused on analyzing real-world survey data from Alimosho Local Government Area, Lagos, Nigeria. Participants explore soft drink availability, packaging, outlet types, and brand presence to uncover insights into market distribution, consumer trends, and brand dominance.

Your mission: Create an interactive or static dashboard (or series of visualizations) that reveals meaningful insights from the data and tells a clear story about soft drink distribution, brand dominance, and consumer trends.
