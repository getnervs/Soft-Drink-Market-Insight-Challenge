# Soft-Drink-Market-Insight-Challenge

The Soft Drink Market Insight Challenge is a data visualization competition focused on analyzing real-world survey data from Alimosho Local Government Area, Lagos, Nigeria. Participants explore soft drink availability, packaging, outlet types, and brand presence to uncover insights into market distribution, consumer trends, and brand dominance.
